# Classification Portal
For beginners who are starting to learn Machine Learning, they might want to find a hub where they can upload datasets and run different ML models on these datasets to understand how these models work. It's extremely time consuming for them to write their own script and deploy them in some environment. 

This portal provides some models that can do simple classification tasks and allow users to upload their data and output the results.
